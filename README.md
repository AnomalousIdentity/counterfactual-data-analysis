Code from Data science research project (Personal contributions to a part of a larger project)

1. Two types of possible tests for data files: Signed rank test and Wilcoxon signed rank test
2. Code is able to extract data from medical data and use a counterfactual way to predict the populations most affected based off 3 attributes
3. Attributes are manually set in the code but can be altered to include age, gender, and etc.
4. Code compares each month with the previous month to determine the population most affected
5. Results are outputted to a new file
